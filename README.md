# RNA-Folding-Problem

# RNA Project

This repository contains scripts for analyzing RNA structures and computing interaction profiles and pseudo-energies.

## Scripts

### 1. `training.py`

- **Description**: Import libraries, parse PDB data, calculate distance distributions, compute observed and reference frequencies, and compute log-ratios.

### 2. `plotting.py`

- **Description**: Plot interaction profiles using pseudo-energies for different nucleotide pairs.

### 3. `scoring.py`

- **Description**: Perform scoring using interpolation functions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/moonblume/RNA-Folding-Problem.git>

**Dependencies**
Python 3
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib


**Data**
The PDB file used for analysis is located in the /main directory.
